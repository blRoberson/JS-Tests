# Practice Repo to learn Git and Github with VS Code.

This is the Repo where I will be working on figuring out how github and git work with VS Code so that I can one day make some projects and have them accross devices.
Right now, I have no way to work on a project across multiple computers. I am hoping this will fix that issue.
